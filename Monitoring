Continuous Monitoring --> why?

1. Health Check
2. Performance of the system
3. Alerting
4. Metrics:
	CPU
	Memory
	Disk
	Response time
	Status Code
	Errors/Exceptions in the logs:

	--> Depends on the architectural components
	slow queries
	read/write latency

	Kafka lags

Monitoring tool is required:
1. Prometheus / Grafana --> Kubernetes
2. ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Alerting --> monitor 24 * 7
